# Land Use classification using Convolutional Neural Network

## Description
The Purpose of this Project is to classify land use image using [*Convolutional Neural Network*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). The dataset used for this project is the [UC Merced dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18mva7AbCzf-rHpW5SEzpVDtoXAcVD5Mf/view?usp=sharing), which consists of 21 land use classes. The structure of the data set is as following:


This project is developed by using [Python3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/), [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org) as a backend and [Keras](http://keras.io/) as high level deep learning library.



Approaches

### This project is related during the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning [course](http://chrome.ws.dei.polimi.it/index.php?title=Artificial_Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning).
The goal of this project is to find a model that assign the corresponding class to the given images. There are 21 different classes. We will do this with the Convolutional Neural Network.
The UC Merced Land Use Dataset is used as the dataset in this project. you can download the data set [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18mva7AbCzf-rHpW5SEzpVDtoXAcVD5Mf/view?usp=sharing)

# This project is done during the [Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://chrome.ws.dei.polimi.it/index.php?title=Artificial_Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning).
The goal of this project is to find a model that assign the corresponding class to the given images. There are 21 different classes. We will do this with the Convolutional Neural Network.
The UC Merced Land Use Dataset is used as the dataset in this project. you can download the data set [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18mva7AbCzf-rHpW5SEzpVDtoXAcVD5Mf/view?usp=sharing)

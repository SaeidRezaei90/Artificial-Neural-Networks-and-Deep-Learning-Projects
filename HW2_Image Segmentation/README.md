## Problem description
In this assignment the task of multiclass semantic segmentation for Bipbip dataset drawn from the first round of [ACRE Cascade Competition](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/27176) is being studied. ACRE is the Agri-food Competition for Robot Evaluation, part of the METRICS project funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 871252. Autonomous robots compete to demonstrate their ability to perform agricultural tasks (such as removing weeds or surveying crops down to individual-plant resolution).  The same network, maybe with a little bit of different parameters or fine tunings, can be used for other type of the datasets (PEAD, ROSEAU, WeedElec) in the competition.
Basically, you are given some images of different classes, and different kinds, and the task is to write a segmentation algorithm such that a robot can perform accurate separation from weed/crop classification.
